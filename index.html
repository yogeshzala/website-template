          <h6>OUR STORY</h6>
          <h2>ABOUT SPLIT ROCK COFFEE</h2>
          <p>
            Split Rock Coffee was founded with this simple idea: bring the high
            quality coffee usually found only in coffee houses to offices and
            retail customers. <br /><br />

            Although we are a new company, our staff brings years of experience
            in the coffee industry. Our veteran coffee buyer has worked for
            twenty years in the specialty coffee market on behalf of a
            successful chain of coffee shops, as well as a wholesale, retail,
            and office coffee company. We work closely with a Midwest coffee
            importer that is a leader in the global specialty coffee industry.
            We follow the philosophy of purchasing coffees that are in season
            and then blending them to bring our customers the freshest beans
            available. Split Rock coffee is roasted by a Minnesota master
            roaster, who balances the art and science of roasting fine coffee
            that comes from over 25 years of experience. Our distribution
            partner is a paper and packaging supply company that has been
            serving businesses in Minnesota for over one hundred years.
            <br /><br />

            The journey a coffee bean makes from the farm to the cup is full of
            small steps that must be perfectly coordinated to preserve the
            quality and flavor of the coffee. Our buyer has travelled to the
            countries of origin and met with coffee farmers in their fields,
            marveling at the complexity of moving coffee from remote parts of
            the world to market. Our coffee importer has built such strong
            relationships with growers that many deals are closed with just a
            handshake. <br /><br />

            Choosing the highest quality beans, roasting them to perfection, and

        <h6>BLENDED TO PERFECTION</h6>
        <h2>OUR COFFEE</h2>
        <p>
          Split Rock’s coffee buyer started his career as a chef, choosing and
          combining flavors to create award-winning dishes. Creating a great cup
          of coffee happens the same way. Coffees from around the world have
          flavor compounds that reflect the soil structure and altitude at which
          they are grown, as well as the water supply, sunlight or shade, and
          other growing conditions. Some coffee growing regions are known for
          the distinct body found in the coffees they grow; other areas produce
          coffees with a citrus acidity, or in rarer cases, fruity overtones.
          <br /><br />
          The roasting process needs to also take other qualities into account.
          Some coffees are soft, with a less dense cell structure, and are best
          lightly roasted, while others are hard or dense, and dark roasting
          brings out the flavors in the bean. Our coffee buyer utilizes his
          culinary and coffee buying experience to create blends that work best
          at each roast level, carefully testing them to be sure that the
          flavors are balanced in the final cup. Split Rock coffee blends are
          sure to please the most discriminating palate.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h5>Light Roast</h5>
        <p>
          Our Light Roast is 100% Colombian from the Huila (Southern) region of
          Colombia. The lighter roast style is balanced, rich and brighter in
          acidity then the dark and medium roasts. This Single Origin coffee is
          a great example of Colombian coffee.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h5>Medium Roast</h5>
        <p>
          Our Medium Roast is a traditional Breakfast Blend. This blend
          highlights the body of Strictly High Grown (SHG) Central American, the
          mild acidity of East African, and the smooth finish of the South
          American coffees. Medium Roast has notes of sweet chocolate with a
          dark cherry finish, and makes a great choice for Espresso.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h5>DARK Roast</h5>
        <p>
          Our Dark Roast is reminiscent of a light French Roast. The combination
          of Central American and Indonesian coffee beans produces a great
          balance of body and acidity. The beans naturally occurring dark cocoa,
          and bittersweet chocolate flavors work well with cream or milk.
